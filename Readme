Socket:
A socket is a channel for 2 parties to communicate over a network
For many use-cases,
	1. The client is the one initiating the channel
	2. The server is the one waiting for new clients

Redis application uses TCP and provides a continuous stream of bytes

File descriptor(Socket descriptor) - is an integer that uniquely represent a network socket
	socket() call allocates and returns the descriptor which is later used to create the communication channel

A TCP server listens on a particular address(IP + port) and accepts client connection from that address. 

2 types of socket handles:
	1. Listening sockets: Obtained by listening on address
	2. Connection sockets: Obtained by accepting a client connection from listening socket
